# RAG-based-Question-Answering-Web-Interface
This project implements a web-based question-answering (QA) system using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The system allows users to ask questions in Persian about the contents of a PDF document (e.g., Drugs.pdf), with a focus on topics like Diclofenac. The interface is built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive web applications, and is designed to run on Google Colab with a public URL exposed via ngrok. The RAG model combines a large language model (LLM) with a vector store to retrieve relevant document chunks and generate accurate answers.
